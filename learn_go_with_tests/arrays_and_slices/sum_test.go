//TODO: Read more about the format strings https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/
//TODO: Review: If you had initialized go mod with go mod init main you will be presented with an error _testmain.go:13:2: cannot import "main". This is because according to common practice, package main will only contain integration of other packages and not unit-testable code and hence Go will not allow you to import a package with name main.
